# Ideas when developing

- [ ] Filter Color in interaction (color is in workshop, color is quarry)
- [ ] With the shortcuts the action need to be more precise in the message
- [ ] Pick interaction - Dont show amount if not possible to pick from quarry can pick 3 stones but only 2 stones left in quarry
- [ ] Replace did_nothing action with ended_turn
- [X] In ChooseACtion Staget two interactions "Confirm End of Turn" "Restart Turn" 
- [ ] Dont show actions in ChooseAction Phase if it was already used this turn
